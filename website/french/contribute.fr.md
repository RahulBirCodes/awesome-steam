## Quality Standards

While we welcome new contributions, we don't want Awesome STEAM to become a dumping ground of loosely related content. Therefore, this list is not meant to hold everything, just the high quality stuff.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1 

If you haven't already, create a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

### Step 2

### Step 3

Under the section named **README.md** you should see a bullet point list with the options science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. Select the section you want to add content to.

### Step 4

At the top of the content, there is a toolbar like this.
